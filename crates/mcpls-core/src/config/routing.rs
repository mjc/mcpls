//! Explicit per-tool routing (#174).
//!
//! `language_id` alone is not a unique server identity: two servers can
//! share one language (e.g. pyright and pylsp both for `python`), each
//! handling a different subset of MCP tools. This module defines the typed
//! vocabulary for that routing — [`ServerId`], [`ToolKind`] — and
//! [`ToolRouter`], which resolves `(language, tool)` to the server that
//! should handle it.
//!
//! `ToolKind` lives here, in `config`, rather than in `mcp` (which is where
//! its variants are semantically drawn from) to keep `config` a leaf module:
//! `mcp` and `bridge` both depend on `config`, so putting `ToolKind` in `mcp`
//! would create a `config -> mcp -> bridge -> config` cycle. When a new
//! routable MCP tool is added, extend [`ToolKind::ALL`] here.
