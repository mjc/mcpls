# Configuration Reference

Complete reference for configuring mcpls.

## Configuration File

mcpls uses TOML format for configuration. The file can be placed in several locations (searched in order):

1. Path specified by `--config` flag
2. `$MCPLS_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./mcpls.toml` (current directory) — **only loaded with `--trust-project-config`** (or
   `MCPLS_TRUST_PROJECT_CONFIG=true`); see [Trusting a Project-Local Config](#trusting-a-project-local-config)
4. Platform user-config directory:
   - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcpls/mcpls.toml`, else `~/.config/mcpls/mcpls.toml`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mcpls/mcpls.toml`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\mcpls\mcpls.toml`

### Trusting a Project-Local Config

A `mcpls.toml` discovered in the current directory controls which command mcpls
spawns as an LSP server (and other workspace settings), so mcpls does not load it
automatically. Running `mcpls` inside an untrusted checkout must not execute
commands from that checkout without explicit consent.

To load a project-local `mcpls.toml`, opt in explicitly:

```bash
mcpls --trust-project-config
# or
MCPLS_TRUST_PROJECT_CONFIG=true mcpls
```

Without this flag, a `./mcpls.toml` in the current directory is ignored (a warning
is logged naming the ignored path) and mcpls falls through to the user config
directory or built-in defaults — including built-in project-marker heuristics, so
e.g. a `Cargo.toml` in the workspace still spawns rust-analyzer. An explicit
`--config <path>` or `$MCPLS_CONFIG` is always trusted, since naming a path is
itself the user's consent.

> [!WARNING]
> `--trust-project-config` (and `MCPLS_TRUST_PROJECT_CONFIG=true`) is a **global**
> trust grant for the whole mcpls process — it is not scoped to a single project.
> Prefer setting it on a per-project MCP client config entry (the `args`/`env` for
> that project's `mcpls` server registration) rather than in your shell profile or
> a user-global MCP client config, so it doesn't silently apply the next time
> mcpls is launched against a different, untrusted checkout.
>
> `$MCPLS_CONFIG` is a second, by-design door past this gate: it is always
> trusted regardless of this flag, including when set to a relative path. A
> repository's own `.envrc` (or similar) exporting `MCPLS_CONFIG=./mcpls.toml`
> would make direnv-style tooling load it automatically — not a bug (an
> explicitly named path is consent, per the design above), but worth knowing if
> you audit a checkout for auto-executing config before running mcpls in it.

## Configuration Structure

```toml
# Workspace configuration
[workspace]
roots = ["/path/to/project1", "/path/to/project2"]
position_encodings = ["utf-8", "utf-16"]

# LSP server definitions (can have multiple)
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "rust"
command = "rust-analyzer"
args = []
file_patterns = ["**/*.rs"]
timeout_seconds = 30
request_timeout_seconds = 30

# Optional: LSP server initialization options
[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
cargo.features = "all"
```

## Workspace Section

### `workspace.roots`

**Type**: Array of strings
**Default**: `[]` (detect the containing project)

Workspace root directories for LSP servers.

When empty, MCPLS walks upward from its current directory. It uses the nearest
Git checkout root (including linked worktrees), or the nearest recognized
project manifest when no Git checkout contains the directory. If neither
exists, MCPLS starts without a default project; add one with `project_add`.

```toml
[workspace]
# Single workspace
roots = ["/Users/username/projects/myproject"]

# Multiple workspaces
roots = [
    "/Users/username/projects/frontend",
    "/Users/username/projects/backend"
]

# Auto-detect (empty array)
roots = []
```

### `workspace.position_encodings`

**Type**: Array of strings
**Default**: `["utf-8", "utf-16"]`
**Options**: `"utf-8"`, `"utf-16"`, `"utf-32"`

Preferred position encodings for LSP communication, offered to each spawned server during the `initialize` handshake in the listed order.

```toml
[workspace]
position_encodings = ["utf-8", "utf-16", "utf-32"]
```

This is a preference, not a restriction: per the LSP spec, UTF-16 is a mandatory fallback encoding, so a server may still reply with UTF-16 even if it's omitted from this list. Most language servers negotiate UTF-16 by default.

### `workspace.language_extensions`

**Type**: Array of `LanguageExtensionMapping` objects
**Default**: 30 built-in language mappings (see below)

Custom file extension to language ID mappings. Allows you to:
- Add support for specialized file types
- Override default extension associations
- Reduce memory usage by including only languages you need

```toml
[workspace]

# Add Nushell support
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["nu"]
language_id = "nushell"

# Override Rust to use custom language ID
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["rs"]
language_id = "custom-rust"

# Add multiple extensions for Python
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["py", "pyi", "pyw"]
language_id = "python"
```

#### Default Language Mappings

mcpls includes 30 language mappings by default:

| Language | Extensions | Language ID |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Rust | rs | rust |
| Python | py, pyw, pyi | python |
| JavaScript | js, mjs, cjs | javascript |
| TypeScript | ts, mts, cts | typescript |
| TypeScript React | tsx | typescriptreact |
| JavaScript React | jsx | javascriptreact |
| Go | go | go |
| C | c, h | c |
| C++ | cpp, cc, cxx, hpp, hh, hxx | cpp |
| Java | java | java |
| Ruby | rb | ruby |
| PHP | php | php |
| Swift | swift | swift |
| Kotlin | kt, kts | kotlin |
| Scala | scala, sc | scala |
| Zig | zig | zig |
| Lua | lua | lua |
| Shell | sh, bash, zsh | shellscript |
| JSON | json | json |
| TOML | toml | toml |
| YAML | yaml, yml | yaml |
| XML | xml | xml |
| HTML | html, htm | html |
| CSS | css | css |
| SCSS | scss | scss |
| Less | less | less |
| Markdown | md, markdown | markdown |
| C# | cs | csharp |
| F# | fs, fsi, fsx | fsharp |
| R | r, R | r |

These defaults are automatically included when you don't specify custom `language_extensions`. If you provide any custom mappings, you must include all languages you want to use.

#### Minimal Configuration Strategy

For better performance, configure only the languages you actually use:

```toml
[workspace]

# Only Rust and Python
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["rs"]
language_id = "rust"

[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["py", "pyi"]
language_id = "python"
```

This reduces memory usage compared to loading all 30 default mappings.

### `workspace.max_documents`

**Type**: Integer
**Default**: `100`

Maximum number of documents mcpls will keep open simultaneously. A tool call (hover, definition, diagnostics, etc.) that would open a document beyond this count fails with a "document limit exceeded" error. Documents stay tracked for the whole mcpls process lifetime — there is no automatic eviction — so once the ceiling is reached, opening any further new file fails until you restart mcpls or raise this limit; already-open files are unaffected. Set to `0` to disable the limit.

```toml
[workspace]
max_documents = 500
```

Raising this limit increases mcpls's steady-state memory usage, since each open document's full content is held in memory. This is most useful for long-running agent sessions or broad-scope work (large monorepo audits, repo-wide refactors) that touch more than 100 distinct files.

### `workspace.max_file_size`

**Type**: Integer (bytes)
**Default**: `10485760` (10MB)

Maximum size, in bytes, of a single file mcpls will open. A file larger than this fails with a "file size limit exceeded" error. Set to `0` to disable the limit.

```toml
[workspace]
max_file_size = 0  # unlimited
```

Useful when a project contains files larger than 10MB (e.g. generated code, data fixtures) that still need LSP-backed tools to work against them.

## LSP Server Configuration

Each `[[lsp_servers]]` section defines a language server.

### `language_id`

**Type**: String
**Required**: Yes

Language identifier for this server.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "rust"  # Standard: rust, python, typescript, javascript, go, etc.
```

### `command`

**Type**: String
**Required**: Yes

Command to execute the language server.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
command = "rust-analyzer"  # Must be in PATH or absolute path
```

For absolute paths:
```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
command = "/usr/local/bin/rust-analyzer"
```

### `args`

**Type**: Array of strings
**Default**: `[]`

Command-line arguments for the language server.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
command = "pyright-langserver"
args = ["--stdio"]  # Many servers require --stdio flag
```

### `file_patterns`

**Type**: Array of strings (glob patterns)
**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)

File patterns to associate with this language server.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
file_patterns = ["**/*.rs"]  # Rust files

[[lsp_servers]]
file_patterns = ["**/*.py", "**/*.pyi"]  # Python files

[[lsp_servers]]
file_patterns = ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"]  # TS/JS files
```

Glob pattern syntax:
- `**` - Match any number of directories
- `*` - Match any characters except `/`
- `?` - Match single character
- `[abc]` - Match any character in brackets

### `timeout_seconds`

**Type**: Integer
**Default**: `30`

Timeout in seconds for the `initialize` handshake during server startup.
Servers that load a large project before answering `initialize` (e.g.
OmniSharp on a big Unity/C# solution) need this raised - the default 30 s can
otherwise cut the server off mid-initialization.

This does **not** bound individual tool-call requests (hover, definition,
references, etc.) sent after initialization - see `request_timeout_seconds`
below for that. The LSP server's `shutdown` request during teardown uses a
separate, fixed 5 s timeout that is not configurable.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
timeout_seconds = 60  # Increase for servers slow to complete `initialize`
```

### `request_timeout_seconds`

**Type**: Integer
**Default**: `30`

Timeout in seconds applied to each individual LSP request issued while
translating an MCP tool call (hover, definition, references, diagnostics,
rename, etc.). Independent of `timeout_seconds`, which only bounds the
`initialize` handshake.

This bounds a single request **attempt**, not a whole tool call: when the LSP
server responds with `-32802` (content modified), mcpls retries up to 4
attempts total with exponential backoff (0.5 s + 1 s + 2 s = 3.5 s of total
sleep). So the worst-case latency for one tool call is:

```
4 * request_timeout_seconds + 3.5 seconds
```

If a tool call also triggers a server respawn (because the previous server
process had died), add `timeout_seconds` on top of that, since
`initialize` runs again before the request is retried.

Completion requests (`textDocument/completion`) are further capped at 10
seconds regardless of this setting - completions are latency-sensitive
enough that a slower result isn't useful, and this cap cannot currently be
raised. If completions specifically need a higher ceiling, file an issue
requesting a dedicated `completion_timeout_seconds` field rather than raising
`request_timeout_seconds`, which would not affect completions above 10 s.

A value of `0` is rejected at config load time; the effective timeout is
always at least 1 second.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
request_timeout_seconds = 60  # Increase for a slow LSP server (e.g. large monorepo indexing)
```

### `initialization_options`

**Type**: Table (key-value pairs)
**Default**: `{}`

Server-specific initialization options passed during LSP initialization.

```toml
[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
# rust-analyzer specific options
cargo.features = "all"
checkOnSave.command = "clippy"

# pyright specific options
python.analysis.typeCheckingMode = "strict"
```

See your language server documentation for available options.

### `env`

**Type**: Table (key-value pairs)
**Default**: `{}`

Environment variables to set for the LSP server process.

The spawned server does **not** inherit mcpls's full environment. Its
environment is cleared, then a minimal allowlist is passed through from
mcpls's own process — `PATH`, `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`, `TMPDIR`/`TEMP`/`TMP` on
every platform, plus Windows essentials (`SystemRoot`, `APPDATA`,
`LOCALAPPDATA`, and others the process loader and Node-based servers need) —
and only then is `env` applied on top, so entries here can override any
passthrough value. Use `env` to restore anything your server needs beyond
that allowlist: proxy settings, `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`PYTHONPATH`, toolchain
variables a `build.rs` reads (`DATABASE_URL`, `LIBCLANG_PATH`, …), or
session-specific values like `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "python"
command = "pyright-langserver"
args = ["--stdio"]
file_patterns = ["**/*.py"]

[lsp_servers.env]
PYTHONPATH = "/custom/path"
VIRTUAL_ENV = "/path/to/venv"
```

**Caution:** setting `PATH` here *replaces* the passthrough value rather than
prepending to it, and the two platforms then diverge — Unix searches your
explicit `PATH` first, so a bare `command` (no directory component) becomes
unresolvable unless your `PATH` entry still contains it; Windows still falls
back to searching the parent's `PATH` afterward. If you only need to add a
directory, prefer an absolute path in `command` over overriding `PATH`.

### `name`

**Type**: String
**Default**: the server's `language_id`

Explicit routing identity for this server. Two servers may share one
`language_id` (e.g. two Python servers), but each must have a distinct
identity — set `name` on at least one of them so they don't collide.

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
name = "pyright"
language_id = "python"
command = "pyright-langserver"
args = ["--stdio"]

[[lsp_servers]]
name = "pylsp"
language_id = "python"
command = "pylsp"
handles = ["diagnostics"]
```

### `handles`

**Type**: Array of tool names
**Default**: unset (catch-all — serves every tool no other server for this language explicitly claims)

Restricts a server to exactly the listed routing values. Valid values:
`hover`, `definition`, `type_definition`, `implementation`, `references`,
`diagnostics`, `rename`, `completions`, `signature_help`,
`document_symbols`, `workspace_symbols`, `format_document`, `code_actions`,
`call_hierarchy`, `inlay_hints`. These are routing identifiers, not MCP tool
names — several MCP tools map to a shorter routing value:

| `handles` value | MCP tool(s) it governs |
|---|---|
| `rename` | `rename_symbol` |
| `workspace_symbols` | `workspace_symbol_search` |
| `implementation` | `go_to_implementation` |
| `type_definition` | `go_to_type_definition` |
| `call_hierarchy` | `prepare_call_hierarchy`, `get_incoming_calls`, `get_outgoing_calls` (one route: the item `prepare_call_hierarchy` returns is only meaningful to the server that produced it) |
| `diagnostics` | `get_diagnostics` (pull) **and** `get_cached_diagnostics` (the push-notification cache is filtered by the same route, so both are always served by the same server) |

Every other value matches its MCP tool name directly (`hover` → `hover`, etc.).

At most one server per language may omit `handles` (the catch-all). A tool
may be claimed by only one server per language. In the example above,
`pylsp` handles only diagnostics; `pyright` (the catch-all) handles
everything else for `python`, including `hover`, `definition`, etc.

**Ambiguous configs fail at startup, not silently.** If two servers for one
language are *both applicable in the same workspace* (see
`heuristics` below) and either share a routing identity, both omit
`handles`, or both claim the same tool, mcpls refuses to start and prints an
error naming the conflicting `[[lsp_servers]]` entries. A config with
mutually exclusive `heuristics.project_markers` — where only one of the two
servers is ever applicable in a given workspace — is not ambiguous and
starts normally.

**If the server a tool is routed to fails to spawn**, that tool's requests
move to the language's catch-all server, if one is running; otherwise they
report no server available for that tool rather than silently falling back
to a server that explicitly declined it via `handles`.

**Exception: `workspace_symbol_search`.** This tool has no document, so it
has no language to route on. It resolves, across all configured servers, to
the first one that explicitly claims `workspace_symbols`, else the first
catch-all. Unlike every document-scoped tool above, there is no per-language
fallback to try (`handles` is per-language, and this tool has no language) —
if neither an explicit claimer nor a catch-all exists anywhere in the
workspace, the request fails naming the tool rather than being forwarded to
an arbitrary server that declined it via `handles`. Add `workspace_symbols`
to a server's `handles` list, or configure a catch-all, to enable this tool.

## Environment Variables

### `MCPLS_CONFIG`

Path to configuration file.

```bash
export MCPLS_CONFIG=/custom/path/to/mcpls.toml
mcpls
```

### `MCPLS_LOG`

Log level for mcpls output.

**Values**: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`
**Default**: `info`

```bash
export MCPLS_LOG=debug
mcpls
```

### `MCPLS_LOG_JSON`

Output logs in JSON format.

**Values**: `1`/`0`, `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `y`/`n`, `on`/`off` (case-insensitive)
**Default**: `false`

```bash
export MCPLS_LOG_JSON=true
mcpls
```

### `MCPLS_LISTEN` (transport-http feature)

Bind address for Streamable HTTP transport. When set, mcpls binds this address
instead of using stdio.

```bash
export MCPLS_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:3000
mcpls
```

### `MCPLS_HTTP_PATH` (transport-http feature)

URL prefix the MCP service is mounted at.

**Default**: `/mcp`

```bash
export MCPLS_HTTP_PATH=/api/mcp
mcpls
```

## Complete Examples

### Rust Project (Zero Config)

mcpls works without configuration for Rust:

```bash
# No configuration needed!
mcpls
```

### Python Project

```toml
[workspace]
roots = ["/Users/username/projects/myapp"]

[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "python"
command = "pyright-langserver"
args = ["--stdio"]
file_patterns = ["**/*.py"]
timeout_seconds = 45

[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
python.analysis.typeCheckingMode = "basic"
python.analysis.autoSearchPaths = true
```

To use [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/) instead of the default Pyright server:

```toml

### Custom Language Support (Nushell Example)

```toml
[workspace]
roots = ["/Users/username/projects/scripts"]

# Add Nushell language support
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["nu"]
language_id = "nushell"

# Keep Rust support for other scripts
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["rs"]
language_id = "rust"

# Shell scripts
[[language_extensions]]
extensions = ["sh", "bash"]
language_id = "shellscript"

# Configure Nushell LSP server
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "nushell"
command = "nu"
args = ["--lsp"]
file_patterns = ["**/*.nu"]
timeout_seconds = 30

# rust-analyzer for Rust scripts
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "rust"
command = "rust-analyzer"
args = []
file_patterns = ["**/*.rs"]
```

## Command-Line Flags

mcpls supports configuration via command-line flags:

```bash
# Specify config file
mcpls --config /path/to/mcpls.toml

# Set log level
mcpls --log-level debug

# Enable JSON logging
mcpls --log-json

# HTTP transport (requires transport-http feature)
mcpls --listen 127.0.0.1:3000
mcpls --listen 127.0.0.1:3000 --http-path /api/mcp

# Show version
mcpls --version

# Show help
mcpls --help
```

## Configuration Validation

Test your configuration:

```bash
# mcpls will validate config on startup
mcpls --log-level debug

# Check for errors in logs
# Valid config will show: "Configuration loaded successfully"
```

Common validation errors:
- Missing required fields (`language_id`, `command`, `file_patterns`)
- Invalid TOML syntax
- Command not found in PATH
- Invalid glob patterns

## Performance Tuning

### Large Projects

For large codebases, increase timeouts:

```toml
[[lsp_servers]]
language_id = "rust"
command = "rust-analyzer"
args = []
file_patterns = ["**/*.rs"]
timeout_seconds = 120         # 2 minutes for initial indexing
request_timeout_seconds = 60  # slower tool-call responses (see the field's docs above for the retry-ceiling math)
```

### Multiple Workspaces

Limit workspace roots to active projects:

```toml
[workspace]
# Don't include entire home directory!
roots = [
    "/Users/username/active-project",
    "/Users/username/dependency-project"
]
```

### Server-Specific Optimizations

#### rust-analyzer

```toml
[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
cargo.features = "all"
checkOnSave.enable = true
checkOnSave.command = "clippy"
files.excludeDirs = ["target", ".git"]  # Skip build artifacts
```

#### pyright

```toml
[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
python.analysis.typeCheckingMode = "basic"  # "strict" is slower
python.analysis.diagnosticMode = "openFilesOnly"  # Faster
```

#### typescript-language-server

```toml
[lsp_servers.initialization_options]
diagnostics.ignoredCodes = [6133, 6192]  # Disable some slow checks
```
